### Retrieve Requests from the Database:
 You'll need to query the database to retrieve the user requests that need confirmation. This involves selecting the relevant records from the database table where the requests are stored.

### Display Requests for Confirmation:
 Once you have retrieved the requests from the database, you can display them in a user-friendly format for the admin to review and confirm.

### Implement Confirmation Mechanism:
 Provide a way for the admin to confirm each request. This could involve adding a button or a checkbox next to each request, allowing the admin to indicate that they have reviewed and confirmed it.

### Update Database with Confirmation Status: 
After the admin confirms a request, you'll need to update the corresponding record in the database to reflect that it has been confirmed. This could involve setting a flag or updating a status column.
